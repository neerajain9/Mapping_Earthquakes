# Mapping_Earthquakes
(Module 13 Challenge)

## Overview
Basil and Sadhana are excited to see our map layouts. They liked it so much that they now wonder, wouldn't it be nice to have additional couple of layers on the top of it. They'd like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates location on the earth. Also, they'd like to spot all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on out map. It wouldn't be informative if do not associate adequate popups with relavent data.

## Results
### Deliverable-1 (Tectonic Plate Data)
Tectonic data is in the BLUE lines in the map below

### Deliverable-2 (All Major Earthquake)
We have used 
1. Teal-color for magnitudes < 5,
1. Blue-color for magnitudes >=5 but less than 6, and
1. Bright Red-color for magnitudes >= 6

### Deliverable-3 (Additional Map Layer)
We have added a dark base layer to our maps for a dramatic view.

## Summary
This is how our map shows up on initial load.
